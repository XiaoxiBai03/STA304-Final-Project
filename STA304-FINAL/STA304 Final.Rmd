## Abstract

The report aims to predict who will get more votes in 2019 Canadian federal election by building an MRP model based on CES and post-hierarchical data sets. To build the model, we use the survey data set 2019 CES online survey to observe the demographic data: cps19_gender, cps19_province, cps19_education, and voting intention: cps19_votechoice. And choose Census Data “Highest level of educational attainment (general) since some variables such as sex and selected age groups” (Government of Canada, 2017) could be used to show the count and percentage distribution of each geographic level of the 2016 Census, according to education level, gender, and the highest education level of the selected age group. We assume that there is no significantly change in the population from 2016 to 2019, so that the Canadian population data of 2016 can be treated as latest census result. For the purpose of predicting who will be selected for the post-stratification, with "everyone" voting, the results of the Canadian federal election in 2019 could be  predicted, and the importance of voting is learned.

## Introduction

In current days, many social medias are seeking methods to make predictions in election result before the election date. There are also many researchers seek to determine who turns out to vote and
how they vote. The research about voting relies on public records including voter's information. In these experiments, citizens are randomly selected to
receive a message—perhaps in person, on the phone, in the mail, or online—and
then are surveyed alongside a control group whose members do not. Yet such
designs might possess potential bias since the treatment could influence participation in the
follow-up survey. Therefore, it is important to use some effective methods to make predictions for election result. 

The development of MRP as a method has focus on how to use the richest
possible post-stratification frames (Lauderdale et al, 2017) and how to ensure that the multilevel regression models employ as rich and as extensive a range of predictor variables as possible

In this summary report, we use two real dataset, one is ces2019_web, which is about the vote choice in survey 2019. Another one is 2016 census information date, called census_2016. The first, sample, contains 37960 observations from the individuals that form our sample (i.e., n rows). For each individual we have their gender, living area and education level, as well as their vote choice gender. In the second sample, we got the information of census in 2016, which includes gender, living area and education level of the overall population. In the Methodology section (Section 2), I , perform data analysis and explain the MRP model created by using two real data. Results of the analysis in MRP model  are provided in the Results section (Section 3), and inferences of this data along with conclusions are presented in Conclusion section (Section 4).

## Methodology

### MRP models

In summary, there are three stages which must be carried out when conducting an analysis of local
opinion using MRP:

1. Conduct or compile survey information which contains information on voters’ background characteristics, and information on which area the
voters lives in;

2. Estimate a multilevel regression model using the information.

3. Obtain or construct a post-stratification frame which contains overall population information.

4. Make predictions from the multilevel regression model estimated in stage 3 for

The process to use a multi-level logistic regression model to predict preference for cats in the sample given the variables that we will use to post-stratify. Note that we actually have more rows in the post-stratification matrix than the we have observed units, so there are some cells in the poststrat matrix that we don’t observe. We can use a multi-level model to partially pool information across the different levels within each variable to assist with this. In the model described below, we use a fixed intercept for gender, and hierarchically modeled varying intercepts for each of the other factors. The generalized linear model and linear model with fixed effects are used.

1. The generalized linear model model is designed as follows:

$$logit(p_i) = X_i^T \beta$$

where here X  contains an indicator for male or levels of education. Adding the varying intercepts for the other variables the model becomes

$$logit(p_i) = X_i^T \beta + \alpha(state[i])$$
with the 
$\alpha(state[i])$ follows a normal distribution.

2. The linear model model with fixed effects is designed as follows:

$$Y_i = X_i^T \beta + \alpha(state[i])$$
with the 
$\alpha(state[i])$ follows a normal distribution.

After getting a summary of the baseline log odds of cat preference at the first element of each factor. We then estimate voter choice in the population by accounting for differences between our sample and the population. Finally, we could obtain posterior estimates for voter choice given the proportion of people in the population in each level of the factors included in the model.

Here we use the lme4 package and built in glmer and lmer function to conduct complicated regression analyses and build in the post-stratification frame.

### Data Analysis

The original census data have multiple variables, to reduce computation difficulties, we select the most important variables, which include gender, education level and state. For education level, to keep the original data consistent with the census in 2016, we take separate to overall 6 degrees, where 1 to 6 stands for no certificate, secondary high school certificate, Apprenticeship certificate, College degree, University with bachelor degree, and University with bachelor degree or above. Also, the original vote choice has 9 different values. To make it a binary case for logistic models, we only consider two majority parties, which is liberal party and Conservative party.

## Result
Based on the result of models, we may conclude several interesting things. First, the intercept for male is negative while the intercept for female is positive, it would imply that male tend to vote for Liberal party while female tend to vote for Conservative Party. We also noticed that the willingness to vote for Conservative Party tends to decline as people has higher educational level. It implies that people with higher education tend to vote for Conservative Party and people with lower education tend to vote for Liberal Party.

\end{figure}   

For generalized linear model, the posterior probability that  Conservative Party wins is 0.462, versus the wining probability equals to 0.538 for Liberal Party. For linear model, the posterior probability that  Conservative Party wins is 0.461, versus the wining probability equals to 0.539 for Liberal Party. We may see that both models have similar posterior probability, and both of the results imply that
Liberal Party has a little higher wining probability than Conservative Party. We are likely to say Liberal Party is more likely to win the election in 2020 because of the higher posterior probability


## Discussion

In summary, we successfully building an MRP model based on CES and post-hierarchical data sets to predict who will get more popular votes in the Canadian federal election in 2019 by  using the survey data set 2019 CES online survey to observe the demographic data. 

Based on out data analysis, we draw an conclusion that the winning probabilities for Liberal Party is a little higher than Conservative Party. Our secondary outcome is that female tend to vote for Conservative Party and male tend to vote for Liberal party. High educated people also tend to vote for Liberal Party. 

In general, our method provides some broader methodological guidance for
dealing with voting surveys. In our model, we simply the variable to gender, education level and state. In practice, the appropriateness of the model depends on the variables used, the relationship between those variables
and the opinion being modeled, and the relationship between unmeasured variables
and the opinion being modeled. One author improvement could involve more variables in the model and explore which variable could be useful in prediction.

Another possible improvement would be about the model itself, we build a logistic model with binary outcome. Researchers could also build multi-level outcome models to improve the prediction accuracy. We could also consider relationships of our variable, for example, to detect interaction between two models.
